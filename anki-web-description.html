<b>Known issues</b>
In the Anki 2.1 version when <code>hide_on_startup</code> is set to <code>True</code>, the tray icon does not appear if the profile manager is shown when Anki is started. So this option should be activated only when a single user is present or when Anki is started with the <code>-b PROFILE</code> option so that the profile manager is not displayed.
